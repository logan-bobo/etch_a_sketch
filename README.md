# etch a sketch

Implementation of an etch a sketch in Javascript that has the following functionality:
- User can define a grid based on width of up to 32 nodes of equal size fitting in a 500px div.
- Click and drag to fill grid nodes.
- Add a rainbow mode that will fill a grid with a random color and allow this mode to be toggled.
- When a node is entered for a second time the node will become darker in 10 equal intervals allowing the user to shade Nodes.
- Allow users to reset their grid.
- Allow users to redefine the node density (amount of nodes in the grid) at will.
